Q: If I want to make a library for the //+ project how would you recommend doing it?
A: For a start you would have to build the library in //+ for xlib, if you wish to use an other language for the library you will need to use xlib for running the code. We recommend using compiled C++ or Python for your library and to base your syntax off of //+ syntax.
